# Status

Living document — what actually exists vs. what's planned. The sprint
table in `architecture/10-roadmap-and-acceptance.md` is the plan; this
file is the ground truth of what's built. Update it as work continues.

## Done

**Architecture Pack** (`architecture/`) — all 11 documents, covering the
88-item list from `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §79. Not reviewed/approved by a
human yet — treat decisions in it as a strong starting point, not
untouchable.

**Sprint 1 — Foundation** (scaffolded and tested, not yet reviewed):

- `apps/api`: FastAPI app with organisations, workspaces, users, roles,
  memberships, sessions, audit events. Session-cookie auth (Redis-backed),
  fixed-role RBAC (`app/auth/rbac.py`), two-layer tenant scoping
  (`app/core/tenancy.py` — app-layer + Postgres RLS in the Alembic
  migration). `AdaptiveWorkspaceResolver` (`app/organisations/adaptive.py`)
  computes nav/KPIs/terminology per organisation type. Endpoints: signup,
  login, logout, me, workspace layout. 9 tests passing (SQLite + fake
  Redis — see `app/tests/conftest.py`; Postgres RLS itself is not yet
  covered by an automated test, see "Not yet done" below).
- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 app. Dark marketing/auth shell (landing,
  sign-in, sign-up) and light authenticated app shell (sidebar driven by
  the adaptive workspace layout, top bar, empty-state Home). Design
  tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css` matching `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
  Every other nav destination (`/properties`, `/repairs`, `/compliance`,
  etc.) is a `ComingSoon` stub, not a fabricated screen — see
  `src/components/ComingSoon.tsx`. Production build, typecheck and lint
  all pass; landing/sign-up pages visually verified in-browser.
- `infra/`: `docker-compose.yml` (postgres, redis, api, worker, web),
  Dockerfiles for api/web. **Not run end-to-end** — this machine has no
  Docker installed, so the compose stack, the Alembic migration against
  a real Postgres, and Postgres RLS itself are unverified beyond: (a) the
  migration's DDL was validated via `alembic upgrade head --sql` (offline
  mode, no live DB — confirms syntax, not runtime behaviour), and (b) the
  equivalent business logic passing against SQLite in `apps/api/app/tests`.
  **First thing to do with Docker available: `docker compose -f
  infra/docker-compose.yml up`, then run the security/tenant-isolation
  tests described in architecture/09 §2 for real, against Postgres RLS.**
- `scripts/seed_demo.py`: creates the fictional Northstar Housing org +
  a demo owner login. Foundation-only — no properties/components/etc.
  yet, since those models don't exist until later sprints.

**Sprint 2 — SaaS / Billing** (the non-Stripe half; Stripe itself deferred
per instruction — "continue with sprint 2, billing later"):

- `apps/api/app/platform/billing.py`: `Plan`, `Subscription`,
  `UsageRecord` models; a `PLAN_CATALOG` (Starter/Professional/Business/
  Enterprise, pricing from `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §64, money stored as
  integer pence) lazily upserted into the DB the same way system roles
  are — `ensure_plan_catalog_seeded` keeps the full catalog visible
  regardless of which plans anyone has actually subscribed to yet.
  Signup now creates a 14-day `TRIALING` Starter subscription
  automatically, matching the "no credit card required" marketing copy.
- `app/platform/entitlements.py`: `require_entitlement(key)`, same
  composition pattern as `require_permission` — not yet used by any real
  feature-gated route (nothing exists yet that needs gating), tested
  directly instead.
- `app/integrations/billing_provider.py`: the `BillingProvider` adapter
  boundary architecture/07 §2 calls for. Only `NullBillingProvider` is
  implemented — every checkout/portal call fails loudly with a 503 and a
  specific "billing is not configured" message rather than crashing or
  silently succeeding. `StripeBillingProvider` is the next thing to add
  once Stripe credentials exist; nothing else should need to change
  shape when it lands, since routes only depend on the `BillingProvider`
  Protocol.
- `/api/v1/subscriptions` (get current + entitlements), `/plans` (list
  catalog), `/checkout` and `/portal` (both `billing.manage`-gated,
  currently always 503 via `NullBillingProvider`).
- `apps/web`: `/organisation/billing` is now real — current
  plan/trial-countdown card, all four plans, Upgrade buttons that call
  checkout and show the "not configured yet" message inline rather than
  a broken redirect. Verified end-to-end in-browser (signup → Home →
  Billing → Upgrade click) against a local SQLite+fake-Redis smoke-test
  run of the API — see "Without Docker" below.
- 8 new backend tests (17 total passing): trial subscription on signup,
  full catalog listing, checkout permission boundary (OWNER passes
  permission and hits 503; VIEWER is correctly 403'd before ever reaching
  the billing provider), `NullBillingProvider` behaviour,
  `resolve_entitlements` edge cases.
- Found and fixed along the way: `require_permission` gave a confusing
  403 ("missing permission") instead of 400 when `X-Organisation-Id` was
  simply missing — now checked first, same as `get_tenant_db` already
  did. Frontend also hit two real Next.js 16 / React Compiler ESLint
  rules (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, `react-hooks/immutability`)
  that didn't exist in earlier eslint-config-next — fixed rather than
  suppressed (see `organisation/billing/page.tsx`).

**Sprint 3 — Data Ingestion & Provenance:**

- `app/core/provenance.py`: `ProvenanceMixin` (source_type, source_system,
  source_dataset_id, import_job_id, original_reference, created_by/at,
  updated_by/at) — no real consumer table exists yet (domain entities
  start Sprint 5), so it's tested against a throwaway table
  (`app/tests/test_provenance.py`) ahead of time rather than left
  unverified until something depends on it.
- `app/ingestion/`: `Dataset` / `ImportJob` / `ImportRow` /
  `MappingTemplate` models, and the pipeline (`pipeline.py`):
  UPLOAD → VALIDATE → UNDERSTAND → MAP → REVIEW → IMPORT, exactly the
  staging-table shape architecture/02 §2 specifies (never parse-and-insert
  directly). `/api/v1/uploads` (multipart CSV), `/api/v1/datasets`
  (list/detail/rows), `/mapping` (apply + persist as a reusable
  per-org-per-dataset-type template), `/import`.
- Two dataset types seeded as field dictionaries (`PROPERTIES`,
  `COMPONENTS`) — enough to exercise the pipeline for real; the rest of
  spec §13's dataset list gets a dictionary each as its domain lands.
- Simplifications, each documented at the point they matter (mainly
  `pipeline.py`'s module docstring): **CSV only**, no XLSX/XLS yet.
  VALIDATE/UNDERSTAND run **synchronously** in the upload request, not as
  an RQ-backed background job — the DB shape already matches the
  background-job design, so moving it later is a call-site change, not a
  schema change; not done yet because there's no Redis available in this
  environment to verify a real job queue against (same reasoning as
  Sprint 2's Stripe deferral — build what's genuinely testable now).
  **No object storage** — uploaded files are parsed in memory and
  discarded, not persisted; real file retention is a Sprint 4 (Documents)
  concern. **IMPORT is a registered-importer seam** (`IMPORTERS` dict) —
  empty in Sprint 3 since no canonical domain tables exist to import
  into; running it today is an honest no-op (rows move to `IMPORTED`,
  zero entities created, `importer_registered: false` in the response),
  not a fake success.
- Cleaning: whitespace trimming only, logged per-row
  (`raw_data["_cleaning"]`) so it's visible on review, never silent.
- `apps/web`: `/data-and-uploads` is real — upload form, a mapping-review
  table (dropdown per column, pre-filled from the proposed/template
  mapping), apply/import buttons, and a dataset list. Verified two ways:
  the automated test suite, and real `curl` multipart requests against a
  live (SQLite-backed) run of the API — **the Browser pane's tools
  cannot drive a native file picker** (`form_input` on a `type="file"`
  input throws `InvalidStateError`, a real browser security restriction,
  not a tool bug), so the file-selection step itself was verified via
  curl + pytest rather than a full GUI click-through; everything else
  (empty state, the populated dataset list after a curl-driven upload,
  the 401→sign-in redirect) was verified in-browser.
- 15 new backend tests (32 total passing).
- **A real bug found by hand-testing, not by the original test suite:**
  an unescaped comma in a test CSV ("Flat 4, Oak House") produced one
  extra cell; the pipeline silently truncated it, shifting every
  subsequent field left and marking the corrupted row VALID/IMPORTED.
  Root cause was that every test fixture happened to be well-formed CSV,
  so nothing exercised a ragged row. Fixed: a cell-count mismatch is now
  flagged `INVALID` at staging time with a specific message and excluded
  from import; regression-tested
  (`test_ragged_row_is_flagged_not_silently_misaligned`) using the exact
  malformed input that surfaced it.

## Not yet done

Sprints 4–24 (documents/evidence, every domain model, Ask DataLume,
reporting, hardening) — not started. Full order and scope in
`architecture/10-roadmap-and-acceptance.md`.

Specifically flagged as gaps to close early, not deferred to "later":

- **The ingestion pipeline has no background job queue yet.**
  VALIDATE/UNDERSTAND run synchronously inside the upload request. Fine
  for the small CSVs used in testing; will not hold up against the
  "tens of thousands of properties" performance requirement (spec §72)
  until it moves to `worker/jobs/ingestion.py` behind a real RQ+Redis
  queue — architecture/02 §2 explains why this matters.
- **XLSX/XLS upload isn't supported**, only CSV — needs a real parsing
  library (openpyxl/Polars), deferred rather than half-wired.
- **Uploaded files aren't retained anywhere** — parsed in memory and
  discarded. Real file/evidence storage is a Sprint 4 concern.
- **IMPORT never creates real entities yet** — `IMPORTERS` is empty
  until Sprint 5+ domain tables exist to import into.

- **RLS is unverified against real Postgres.** The policy SQL in
  `alembic/versions/0001_foundation.py` and `0002_billing.py` is written
  correctly per the architecture but has never actually run against a
  live database. Treat tenant isolation as *unconfirmed* until the
  security tests in architecture/09 §2 exist and pass against Postgres.
- **Stripe is not wired up.** `StripeBillingProvider` doesn't exist yet;
  `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` must be set and that class implemented before
  checkout/portal/webhooks do anything real. See
  `app/integrations/billing_provider.py`.
- **There's no membership-invite flow.** Signup creates exactly one
  OWNER; there's no way yet for an OWNER to add a second person to their
  org with a chosen role. The Sprint 2 billing-permission test
  (`test_viewer_cannot_start_checkout`) has to create that membership
  directly via the DB session because no API for it exists.
- MFA fields exist on `User` but there's no enrolment/verification flow
  yet — `mfa_enabled` will always be `False` until that's built.
- No CI pipeline wired up yet (backend pytest + frontend build/lint/test
  should all gate merges once this repo has a remote).

## How to run this locally

**With Docker** (once installed): `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up`,
then in another terminal: `cd apps/api && source .venv/bin/activate &&
python ../../scripts/seed_demo.py` (or run it inside the `api` container).
Web: http://localhost:3100. API: http://localhost:8000/docs.

**Without Docker** (what this session used to verify things):
- API: `cd apps/api && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
  && pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest` — needs Python 3.10+; this
  machine's system Python is 3.9.6, a 3.12 interpreter was fetched via
  `uv python install 3.12` for the `.venv`.
- Web: `cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build` (or `npm run dev`
  for a local server on :3100) — this alone doesn't need the API or a
  database; only signed-in pages do.
- Full browser click-through without Docker/Postgres/Redis: point
  `DATABASE_URL` at a local SQLite file and monkeypatch `redis_client` in
  `app.core.tenancy` / `app.auth.router` with an in-process fake before
  starting uvicorn — `app.tests.conftest.py`'s fixture is the reference
  implementation of both. Import `app.main` (not just `app.core.db`)
  before calling `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`, or the model modules
  never register their tables and `create_all` silently does nothing —
  this bit the first version of the throwaway script used to verify
  Sprint 2 end-to-end.
