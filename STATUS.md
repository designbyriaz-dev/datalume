# Status

Living document — what actually exists vs. what's planned. The sprint
table in `architecture/10-roadmap-and-acceptance.md` is the plan; this
file is the ground truth of what's built. Update it as work continues.

## Done

**Architecture Pack** (`architecture/`) — all 11 documents, covering the
88-item list from `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §79. Not reviewed/approved by a
human yet — treat decisions in it as a strong starting point, not
untouchable.

**Sprint 1 — Foundation** (scaffolded and tested, not yet reviewed):

- `apps/api`: FastAPI app with organisations, workspaces, users, roles,
  memberships, sessions, audit events. Session-cookie auth (Redis-backed),
  fixed-role RBAC (`app/auth/rbac.py`), two-layer tenant scoping
  (`app/core/tenancy.py` — app-layer + Postgres RLS in the Alembic
  migration). `AdaptiveWorkspaceResolver` (`app/organisations/adaptive.py`)
  computes nav/KPIs/terminology per organisation type. Endpoints: signup,
  login, logout, me, workspace layout. 9 tests passing (SQLite + fake
  Redis — see `app/tests/conftest.py`; Postgres RLS itself is not yet
  covered by an automated test, see "Not yet done" below).
- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 app. Dark marketing/auth shell (landing,
  sign-in, sign-up) and light authenticated app shell (sidebar driven by
  the adaptive workspace layout, top bar, empty-state Home). Design
  tokens in `src/styles/tokens.css` matching `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
  Every other nav destination (`/properties`, `/repairs`, `/compliance`,
  etc.) is a `ComingSoon` stub, not a fabricated screen — see
  `src/components/ComingSoon.tsx`. Production build, typecheck and lint
  all pass; landing/sign-up pages visually verified in-browser.
- `infra/`: `docker-compose.yml` (postgres, redis, api, worker, web),
  Dockerfiles for api/web. **Not run end-to-end** — this machine has no
  Docker installed, so the compose stack, the Alembic migration against
  a real Postgres, and Postgres RLS itself are unverified beyond: (a) the
  migration's DDL was validated via `alembic upgrade head --sql` (offline
  mode, no live DB — confirms syntax, not runtime behaviour), and (b) the
  equivalent business logic passing against SQLite in `apps/api/app/tests`.
  **First thing to do with Docker available: `docker compose -f
  infra/docker-compose.yml up`, then run the security/tenant-isolation
  tests described in architecture/09 §2 for real, against Postgres RLS.**
- `scripts/seed_demo.py`: creates the fictional Northstar Housing org +
  a demo owner login. Foundation-only — no properties/components/etc.
  yet, since those models don't exist until later sprints.

**Sprint 2 — SaaS / Billing** (the non-Stripe half; Stripe itself deferred
per instruction — "continue with sprint 2, billing later"):

- `apps/api/app/platform/billing.py`: `Plan`, `Subscription`,
  `UsageRecord` models; a `PLAN_CATALOG` (Starter/Professional/Business/
  Enterprise, pricing from `docs/BUILD_PROMPT.md` §64, money stored as
  integer pence) lazily upserted into the DB the same way system roles
  are — `ensure_plan_catalog_seeded` keeps the full catalog visible
  regardless of which plans anyone has actually subscribed to yet.
  Signup now creates a 14-day `TRIALING` Starter subscription
  automatically, matching the "no credit card required" marketing copy.
- `app/platform/entitlements.py`: `require_entitlement(key)`, same
  composition pattern as `require_permission` — not yet used by any real
  feature-gated route (nothing exists yet that needs gating), tested
  directly instead.
- `app/integrations/billing_provider.py`: the `BillingProvider` adapter
  boundary architecture/07 §2 calls for. Only `NullBillingProvider` is
  implemented — every checkout/portal call fails loudly with a 503 and a
  specific "billing is not configured" message rather than crashing or
  silently succeeding. `StripeBillingProvider` is the next thing to add
  once Stripe credentials exist; nothing else should need to change
  shape when it lands, since routes only depend on the `BillingProvider`
  Protocol.
- `/api/v1/subscriptions` (get current + entitlements), `/plans` (list
  catalog), `/checkout` and `/portal` (both `billing.manage`-gated,
  currently always 503 via `NullBillingProvider`).
- `apps/web`: `/organisation/billing` is now real — current
  plan/trial-countdown card, all four plans, Upgrade buttons that call
  checkout and show the "not configured yet" message inline rather than
  a broken redirect. Verified end-to-end in-browser (signup → Home →
  Billing → Upgrade click) against a local SQLite+fake-Redis smoke-test
  run of the API — see "Without Docker" below.
- 8 new backend tests (17 total passing): trial subscription on signup,
  full catalog listing, checkout permission boundary (OWNER passes
  permission and hits 503; VIEWER is correctly 403'd before ever reaching
  the billing provider), `NullBillingProvider` behaviour,
  `resolve_entitlements` edge cases.
- Found and fixed along the way: `require_permission` gave a confusing
  403 ("missing permission") instead of 400 when `X-Organisation-Id` was
  simply missing — now checked first, same as `get_tenant_db` already
  did. Frontend also hit two real Next.js 16 / React Compiler ESLint
  rules (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, `react-hooks/immutability`)
  that didn't exist in earlier eslint-config-next — fixed rather than
  suppressed (see `organisation/billing/page.tsx`).

## Not yet done

Sprints 3–24 (data ingestion, every domain model, Ask DataLume,
reporting, hardening) — not started. Full order and scope in
`architecture/10-roadmap-and-acceptance.md`.

Specifically flagged as gaps to close early, not deferred to "later":

- **RLS is unverified against real Postgres.** The policy SQL in
  `alembic/versions/0001_foundation.py` and `0002_billing.py` is written
  correctly per the architecture but has never actually run against a
  live database. Treat tenant isolation as *unconfirmed* until the
  security tests in architecture/09 §2 exist and pass against Postgres.
- **Stripe is not wired up.** `StripeBillingProvider` doesn't exist yet;
  `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` must be set and that class implemented before
  checkout/portal/webhooks do anything real. See
  `app/integrations/billing_provider.py`.
- **There's no membership-invite flow.** Signup creates exactly one
  OWNER; there's no way yet for an OWNER to add a second person to their
  org with a chosen role. The Sprint 2 billing-permission test
  (`test_viewer_cannot_start_checkout`) has to create that membership
  directly via the DB session because no API for it exists.
- MFA fields exist on `User` but there's no enrolment/verification flow
  yet — `mfa_enabled` will always be `False` until that's built.
- No CI pipeline wired up yet (backend pytest + frontend build/lint/test
  should all gate merges once this repo has a remote).

## How to run this locally

**With Docker** (once installed): `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up`,
then in another terminal: `cd apps/api && source .venv/bin/activate &&
python ../../scripts/seed_demo.py` (or run it inside the `api` container).
Web: http://localhost:3100. API: http://localhost:8000/docs.

**Without Docker** (what this session used to verify things):
- API: `cd apps/api && python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
  && pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest` — needs Python 3.10+; this
  machine's system Python is 3.9.6, a 3.12 interpreter was fetched via
  `uv python install 3.12` for the `.venv`.
- Web: `cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build` (or `npm run dev`
  for a local server on :3100) — this alone doesn't need the API or a
  database; only signed-in pages do.
- Full browser click-through without Docker/Postgres/Redis: point
  `DATABASE_URL` at a local SQLite file and monkeypatch `redis_client` in
  `app.core.tenancy` / `app.auth.router` with an in-process fake before
  starting uvicorn — `app.tests.conftest.py`'s fixture is the reference
  implementation of both. Import `app.main` (not just `app.core.db`)
  before calling `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`, or the model modules
  never register their tables and `create_all` silently does nothing —
  this bit the first version of the throwaway script used to verify
  Sprint 2 end-to-end.
